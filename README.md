# NLP Practice

This repository is just a showcase of things that can be done with NLP. Although, the models that are being used in this repo aren't anything extremely complicated these models often enough to complete the job at hand.


## QuestionAnswer

In the folder QuestionAnswer contains the code that takes as input a question and tries to output the most probable answer. The data is in the following format <QuestionID, QuestionText, PassageID, Answer>. 

To achieve the given goal, we have tried the following models :
- TF-IDF using the eucledian distance
- TF-IDF using the cosine distance
- Word2Vec
- FastText

## BertTagging

In the folder BertTagging contains the code that tries ....
- A) ... to determine which words are key-word words 
- B) ... tag the key-words with the BILOU encoding scheme

The goals are being attempted using a BERT model.
